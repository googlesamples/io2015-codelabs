    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=27:8F:79:CC:AF:73:B8:C6:2F:7E:04:7E:F8:E8:4A:A3:07:85:37:14%3Bcom.example.android.checkout

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    27:8F:79:CC:AF:73:B8:C6:2F:7E:04:7E:F8:E8:4A:A3:07:85:37:14;com.example.android.checkout

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
</resources>
